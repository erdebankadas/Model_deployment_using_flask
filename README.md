* Flask is a a web application framework written in python, in simple terms it helps end users interact with your python code (in this case our ML models) directly from their web browser without needing any libraries,code files, etc.
Flask enables you to create web applications very easily, hence enabling you to focus your energy more on other important parts of a ML lifecycle like EDA, feature engineering, etc.
